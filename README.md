# Student Exam Performance Prediction Analysis

**Overview**

This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing the "Student Exam Performance" dataset using Python and statistical methods. The dataset consists of various variables related to student exam performance prediction, including study hours, previous exam score, and pass/fail status. Our goal is to explore, analyze, and predict student performance based on these factors.
